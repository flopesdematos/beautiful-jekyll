Submarine canyons are complex and heterogeneous geomorphologic structures highly relevant for the biodiversity and productivity of continental margins. These marine ecosystems play a crucial role in providing valuable goods and services for human well-being but are also increasingly subjected to the effects of anthropogenic pressure and climate change. The natural isolation of canyons may act synergistically with these changes with implications to population connectivity and the biodiversity and ecosystems functioning preservation. Through the use of network analysis, I aim to study species distribution patterns and habitat connectivity in canyons and contribute to understanding deep-sea connectivity and its conservation.

Submarine canyons are complex and heterogeneous geomorphologic structures highly relevant for the biodiversity and productivity 
of continental margins. These marine ecosystems play a key role providing invaluable goods and services for human well-being but 
are also increasingly subjected to the effects of anthropogenic pressure and climate change. The natural isolation of canyons may 
act synergistically with these changes with implications to population connectivity and the biodiversity and ecosystems functioning
preservation. Through the use of network analysis I aim to study species distribution patterns and habitat connectivity in canyons
and contribute to understand deep-sea connectivity and its conservation.

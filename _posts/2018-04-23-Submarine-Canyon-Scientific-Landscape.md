The first paper of my Ph.D. is out ðŸŽ‰ 

This work resulted from a collaboration with scientists of the _International Network for submarine Canyon Investigation and Scientific Exchange_ ([INCISE](http://www.incisenet.org)). Using data mining techniques, we extracted a text corpus from the bibliographic [dataset](https://doi.org/10.17632/kympfxbcwm.1) compiled by the INCISE _Working Group 2_. Then, using semantic and network analysis, we identified and explored the existent knowledge clusters in submarine canyon research and how our knowledge about these amazing features evolved.
